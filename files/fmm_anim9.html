    Dynamics of a cylinderflow simulation using a vortex-based
    discretization and the FMM. The computations run concurrently on a
    multicore CPU and a manycore GPU. It is complicated to use these
    hardware in an optimal way and the approach tested here is based
    on autotuning for performance. Two parameters control the balance
    between offloading onto the GPU vs. CPU work. To the left in blue
    is the number of levels in the FMM-method. A large number of
    levels means that less work is offloaded to the GPU. To the right
    in green is a variable theta that controls the multipole
    acceptance criterion (the theta criterion). A large value of
    theta, say, close to 1, means that a larger number of multipole
    coefficients is used, but also that the communication stencils
    become smaller. The autotuner continuously test varying these
    parameters by measuring the benefits of accepting suggested
    changes. By also measuring how costly each parameter test is, the
    added cost of using the autotuner itself may be controlled.
