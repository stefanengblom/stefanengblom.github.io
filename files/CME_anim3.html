    A biological <i>toggle switch</i> can be formed by two mutually
    cooperatively repressing gene products. Left: suppose that
    initially, the number of molecules of one of the species dominates
    the other species. Then the production of that species is
    inhibited and the system finds a stable state. However, by a
    certain small probability the stochastic noise can make the system
    switch and due to this 'tunneling' effect, the roles of the two
    species suddenly change. Right: here the system starts with the
    same number of molecules of both kinds and the system becomes
    symmetric; this example demonstrates the sensivity with respect to
    the initial configuration.

    Toggle switches are interesting entites because they can be though
    of as a biological transistor. Not much effort needs to be spent
    in switching the state of the system ("1" or "0") and, depending
    on the parameters of the reactions, the switch will with high
    probablity remain in its state.
