    <h1>Simulation of fibers suspended in a liquid</h1>

    <img src="animations/FIBR/f200_20x20x40.gif"> <br><br>

    A total number of 200 fibers are suspended in a liquid governed by
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow">Stokes
    equations</a>; due to gravity they fall downwards. The system is
    here simulated with periodic boundaries in all directions so that
    the total flow becomes that of an 'infinite volume'. Note the
    increasing concentration in the middle of the box. <br><br>

    The dimensions of the box is 20-by-20-by-40 units and each fiber
    is 2 units long.

<br><br>

    <a href="animations/FIBR/f100_20x20x40.gif">Does the flow look
    different if you only suspend 100 fibers?</a>
