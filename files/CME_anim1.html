    <h1>Sample animation</h1>

    <img src="animations/CME/tstani.gif"><br><br>

    The animation displays the time-dependent probability density of a
    very simple interacting chemical system consisting of two species
    that comes to rest at steady-state. Although the density itself is
    in equilibrium, any realization of the system would be fluctuating
    according to this distribution. Note the negative correlation
    which comes from the interaction between the two species; if the
    number of molecules of one of the species increases, then the
    other species will start to disappear from the system due to the
    interaction. Note also the different scales present already in
    this simple example: the transport along the line x = y is very
    fast while the slow diffusion along x y = constant is much slower.

    have been chosen by Matlab)
