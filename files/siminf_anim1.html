    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli_O157:H7"><i>Escherichia
    coli</i> O157:H7</a> is a toxin-producing type of <i>E. coli</i>
    that may cause serious and even deadly disease conditions in
    humans. Bovine cattle act as the main reservoir of the bacteria,
    carrying the bacteria for a limited amount of time during which
    the bacteria is shed to the free environment. Importantly, <i>the
    animals show no sign of the disease</i> and computational modeling
    is an important means by which to understand the actual spread of
    the bacteria. The simulation above shows the dynamics of
    the <i>infectious pressure</i>, essentially the amount of bacteria
    in the free environment. This simulation is very
    strongly <i>data-driven</i> as all actual animal transports are
    included, thus accurately taking the time-varying contact network
    into account. Also, the effect of the varying weather conditions
    is incorporated by using weather data as illustrated in the
    animation below. <br><br>
