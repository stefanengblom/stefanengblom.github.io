    Two galaxies rotating in the opposite direction collide. The total
    number of "stars" in the simulation is about 10000 and the shape
    of each galaxy has been determined by a pre-simulation until quasi
    steady-state was observed. Since the simulation is only 2-D and
    since the number of stars is very limited, the result is at best
    qualitative but serve here as a demonstration of the speed of the
    <a

    note that no <a

    has been included in the simulation.
