In <i>E. Coli</i>, the Min family of proteins are believed to play a
key role in the regulation of symmetric cell division. In a mechanism
thought to be self-organized and to function in a manner similar to
the formation of Turing-patterns, the MinD protein oscillates from
pole to pole with a period close to 40 seconds. Another Min protein,
MinC, co-localizes with MinD and acts as a repressor for the formation
of the cell division site by destabilizing a polymerization. On
average, MinD (and hence MinC) will spend less time near the center
of the cell, allowing the division ring to assemble there.

<br><br>

In the simulation animated above a uniform random initial distribution
of protein was used. After some time regular oscillations were
obtained. In the figure below a series of simulations on bacteria of
increasing length have been performed. It can clearly be seen that the
oscillations stop abruptly at a certain length. If oscillations should
be sustained, some additional effect or term should therefore enter in
the model.
