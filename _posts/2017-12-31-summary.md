*   **Dec 14**: I served as a member of the PhD grading committee of [Ranjita Dutta Roy](http://ki.se/en/people/randut) who successfully defended her thesis [Allosteric regulation of synaptic processes](https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/46125) at Karolinska Institutet.
*   **Dec 11**: [Pavol Bauer](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/pavpa354) successfully defended his thesis [Parallelism in Event-Based Computations with Applications in Biology](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1151116). The opponent was [Markos Katsoulakis](http://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/). _Congratulations!_
*   **Nov 13--17**: I was one of the speaker at the [Workshop IV: Uncertainty Quantification for Stochastic Systems and Applications](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/workshop-iv-uncertainty-quantification-for-stochastic-systems-and-applications/), part of the Program [Complex High-Dimensional Energy Landscapes](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/complex-high-dimensional-energy-landscapes/) at [IPAM](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/), UCLA, CA, USA. See the talk [here.](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/abstract/?tid=14343&pcode=ELWS4)
*   **Oct 10--11**: I participated in the international policy arena [Uppsala Health Summit](http://www.uppsalahealthsummit.se/).
*   **Oct 5**: I just published two chapters related to ongoing research in [URDME](http://www.urdme.org). The first one is S. Engblom: _Stability and Strong Convergence for Spatial Stochastic Kinetics_ (Chapter 3.3, [(doi)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-62627-7_5)). The second is S. Engblom, A. Hellander, P. Lötstedt: _Multiscale Simulation of Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Networks_, (Chapter 2.4, [(doi)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-62627-7_3)), both in [_Stochastic Processes, Multiscale Modeling, and Numerical Methods for Computational Cellular Biology_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-62627-7), by Springer.
*   **Sept 26--27**: [Academy meeting](http://sverigesungaakademi.se/1239.html) in Uppsala.
*   **Sept 4**: we just published a chapter on [SimInf](http://www.siminf.org). The reference is S. Engblom and S. Widgren: _Data-driven computational disease spread modeling: from measurement to parametrisation and control_, Chapter 11 [(doi)](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.host.2017.05.005) in [Disease Modelling and Public Health, Part A](https://www.elsevier.com/books/disease-modelling-and-public-health-part-a/srinivasa-rao/978-0-444-63968-4), Volume 36 of _Handbook of Statistics_ by Elsevier.
*   **Jul 20**: a preprint with Per Lötstedt and Lina Meinecke was posted on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05998). The title of the paper is _Mesoscopic Modeling of Random Walk and Reactions in Crowded Media_ and here we develop a multiscale modeling method wherby the diffusion in a crowded environment may be simulated via a highly efficient mesoscopic model. An implementation of this method, including the numerical experiments performed in the paper, is scheduled for release with [URDME version 1.4](http://www.urdme.org).
*   **June 26**: Major version 5.0.0 of [SimInf](http://www.siminf.org) released on CRAN. As before the manual is available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01421). For a quick example, see the animation [Modeling and simulation of the spread of VTEC](animations/siminf_anim1.html).
*   **June 13**: a paper with Dan Wilson and [Ruth Baker](http://www.iamruthbaker.com/) was posted on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03375). The title of the paper is _Scalable population-level modeling of biological cells incorporating mechanics and kinetics in continuous time_. Selected examples of the method are presented in the paper. An implementation of the method is scheduled for release with [URDME version 1.4](http://www.urdme.org).
*   **June 12**: [Robin Eriksson](http://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N17-232) joined as a PhD student. The title of his project is _Computational Modeling, Parameterization, and Evaluation of the spread of Diseases_. **Welcome!**
*   **May 12**: a paper with Anders Goude was posted on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04116). The paper concerns a high order panel method with applications in airfoil design. The actual method has been implemented in our GPU-branch of the FMM2D-code and the experiments of the paper may be reproduced using the scripts distributed. Download here: [freeware page](freeware).
*   **May 9**: I hosted a visit to Uppsala by [Andreas Milias-Argeitis](http://www.rug.nl/staff/a.milias.argeitis/) from the University of Groningen.
*   **Apr 26--27**: [Academy meeting](http://www.sverigesungaakademi.se/1149.html) in Stockholm.
*   **Mar 28**: I was one of the jury members in the [Young Researcher's Finale Week](https://www.ungaforskare.se/utstallningen/finalen/). See the [post at the Young Academy](http://www.sverigesungaakademi.se/1150.html).
*   **Mar 16**: new release of URDME! Version 1.3 can now be downloaded at [www.urdme.org](http://www.urdme.org). The new manual can be retrieved via [arXiv.](http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2912)
*   **Mar 9--10**: I was involved in organizing [Expedition Mundus at SciFest](http://www.sverigesungaakademi.se/1110.html).
*   **Mar 8**: [Jing Liu](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/jinli971) gave her 1/2-time seminar entitled _Flash X-ray single particle imaging in 3D: computational scalability and resolution assessment_ 10--12 in B/A7:111. The external reviewer was [Silvelyn Zwanzig](http://www2.math.uu.se/~zwanzig/).
*   **Mar 6--7**: visit to Lund University, hosted by [Alexandros Sopasakis](http://www.maths.lu.se/staff/alexandros-sopasakis). I gave a talk with the title [Data-driven computational Epidemics](http://www.maths.lu.se/kalendarium/?event=data-driven-computational-epidemics).
*   **Feb 8--9**: [Academy meeting](http://www.sverigesungaakademi.se/1131.html) in Gothenburg.
*   **Jan 13**: a paper with [Vikram Sunkara](https://www.zib.de/members/sunkara) was published. The paper is _"Preconditioned Metropolis sampling as a strategy to improve efficiency in posterior exploration"_ and discusses a kind of two-level strategy to obtain full posterior exploration in stochastic models of chemical kinetics. See _IFAC-PapersOnLine_ 49(26):89--94 (2016): [(doi)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifacol.2016.12.108).
*   **Jan 2**: a paper we have worked on during some time (with [Carl Nettelblad](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/carln) and [Jing Liu](http://user.it.uu.se/~jinli971)) was submitted and posted on arXiv. The title is _"Assessing Uncertainties in X-ray Single-particle Three-dimensional reconstructions"_ and here we design a method by which the accuracy of reconstructions using X-ray lasers can be determined. See the [arXiv-post](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00338).
